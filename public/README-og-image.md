# OG Image Requirements

You need to create an `og-image.jpg` file in the `public/` directory for proper social media sharing.

## Specifications

- **Dimensions:** 1200x630 pixels
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File size:** Keep under 1MB for optimal loading

## Content Requirements

- Include the "AnyBody Paddlesports" logo
- Feature a scenic paddle boarding image
- Use readable text/branding that shows well on social media
- Ensure the image looks good when cropped to different aspect ratios

## Where it's used

- Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media shares
- Twitter cards (with fallback)
- WhatsApp, Slack, and other messaging app previews

## Current fallback

The site currently references `/og-image.jpg` but will show broken images until this file is created.

## Design tips

- Keep important text and logo in the center 1200x600 area
- Use high contrast colors for readability
- Test how it looks at smaller sizes (social media thumbnails)
